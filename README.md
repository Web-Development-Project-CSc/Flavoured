# Flavoured

***Flavoured*** is an E-commerce web application created as the SWE23004 Web Development course project to showcase the ability of 5 students in full stack developing. The front-end of the application showcases the use of HTML and CSS and EC6 "*JavaScript*", while the back-end utilizes the MERN stack in its development.  

*Flavoured* is an online store that specializes in selling custom and specific food **flavourings** in various **shades**. The idea is to bring all customers the delight of enjoying their favourite snacks ; through emulating their taste and color, in two easy to use products *(powder - liquid)*. Many estimated flavours are available on the store from the get-go contrived of a collection of our team's favourite snacks and multiple surveys that were ran through our university, *MIU,* mates. Our slogan "***Taste the Shades***" was designed to imply that both the visuals and taste of our products mean a lot to us.

## Runtime walkthroughs and *screenshots*

- ### Home page
Upon loading the web application, the first webpage visited is our home page, displaying some information about the company and the idea behind it alongside three of our top sellers.

*In the top corner there's a profile icon where users can **login** or **sign up**. Non-logged users are automatically redirected to the login page if the choose to load their profiles*.

There are two more redirects : "***Support***" and "***Store***" that load their equivalent pages which will be discussed later in this file.

![home](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web-Development-Project-CSc/Flavoured/a6c6156651eb65107af1ce3abaed497474327eb6/HTML/RESOURCE/Runtime/home.png)
***
- ### Login page
If you do not wish to sign up, we have made two dummy accounts for now that allow you to check our functionalities :
   * *Tester*
   A normal user account with email address "**tester@flavoured**.com" and password "**pass**" that will redirect you to that presaved user's profile. 
  
   *The forget my password page will ask you to enter the username password to try and contact you about how to reset it **{still in progress}**.*

![tester](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web-Development-Project-CSc/Flavoured/main/HTML/RESOURCE/Runtime/tester.png)

   * *Admin*
   An admin or moderator account that is the only account with access tot the site dashboard , where all store stats and analysis are included. To login, use our teams email "**flavouredmiu@gmail.com**" with "**12345**" as a password.

![admin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web-Development-Project-CSc/Flavoured/main/HTML/RESOURCE/Runtime/admin.png)  
![dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web-Development-Project-CSc/Flavoured/main/HTML/RESOURCE/Runtime/dashboard.png)

*Please note that these are the only two accounts that will succesfully login as of now 3/26/2023.*
***
- ### Sign up page
If you wish to create your own profile you can click on the sign up button and enter all the required information; name, email, password, address, country, mobile number and birthdate.

**All users must be above 16 years old and the passwords have to match in order for the user application to submit. Please do not forget to read the terms of privacy and checking it for agreement for the process to correctly intake.**

![signup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web-Development-Project-CSc/Flavoured/main/HTML/RESOURCE/Runtime/signup.png)

Upon signing, the browser automatically redirects you to your profile with your just entered info displayed.

*Please note that as of toady, 3/26/2023, all signups are temporary as there is no real backend to save the user info in.*
***
- ### My profie page
Whichever way you wish to proceed, your profile will look the same.
At first all the information are displayed for the user, unedited.

![profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web-Development-Project-CSc/Flavoured/main/HTML/RESOURCE/Runtime/myprofile.png)

All of the displayed information in the "*My Information*" section are ***editable***.

![edits](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web-Development-Project-CSc/Flavoured/main/HTML/RESOURCE/Runtime/edit.png)

The "*My Orders*" section is currently filled with ***dummy*** order data to showcase the design of the page.

![orders](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web-Development-Project-CSc/Flavoured/main/HTML/RESOURCE/Runtime/myorders.png)

As the name suggests, the "*Payment Methods*" allows users to choose their preferred method with the default being ***cash on delivery***. If the user chooses ***mastercard or visa*** the card form will automatically appear to collect the necessary information. **Filling it is a must**.

![cash](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web-Development-Project-CSc/Flavoured/main/HTML/RESOURCE/Runtime/coc.png)

The "***Store***" and "***Support***" do exactly as they do in the homepage; redirect you to their coressponding pages.
***

- ### Store page

Upon loading, the store page will look something like this.

![store](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web-Development-Project-CSc/Flavoured/main/HTML/RESOURCE/Runtime/store.png)

with ***mock*** products all over the page and a non-functional search bar at the top. There are three lists of products so far each containing nine at time ; twenty-seven in total.

You can click on any product name to view its details.

![hover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web-Development-Project-CSc/Flavoured/main/HTML/RESOURCE/Runtime/producthover.png)

Customize the product color and form before adding to your cart by clicking on the cart icon inside the product details.

![buy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web-Development-Project-CSc/Flavoured/main/HTML/RESOURCE/Runtime/buy.png)

Once you are satisfied with your order, click on the cart button below to redirect you to the checkout.

![cart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web-Development-Project-CSc/Flavoured/main/HTML/RESOURCE/Runtime/cart.png)

Users can add or remove items from their cart and see the total price before clicking on the right button to confirm their purchase.
***

- ### Support page
The support page contains some of the most FAQ, frequently asked questions, and their answers as well as some nutritional facts about the product. 

At the very end of the page, there's a section for the customers to ask any of their questions that they still feel are unanswered throughout the page. 

![closed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web-Development-Project-CSc/Flavoured/main/HTML/RESOURCE/Runtime/csupport.png)

If any of the page's contents are clicked, questions or facts, a detailed section shows up to further asist our customers with their query.

![open](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Web-Development-Project-CSc/Flavoured/main/HTML/RESOURCE/Runtime/osuuport.png).
