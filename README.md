A: Project Description
The e-commerce website, flavoured, sells custom food flavourings in powder or liquid form based on popular snack flavors. There are two types of accounts, an admin account with the email flavouredmiu@gmail.com and password 12345 for accessing the admin dashboard, and a user account with the email tester@flavoured.com and password pass for regular users. Users can sign up, log in, edit their profiles, view their orders, and add products to their cart. The website currently has 3 pages of dummy products with the same picture. The support page has FAQs and an option to send an unlisted question.

As part of our project choices, the option of developing an e-commerce website was selected and assigned. The website is being built using the MERN stack, with the frontend pages already constructed and some backend capabilities in place. We aim to create a professional, fully functional e-commerce platform that meets the needs of our target audience.
