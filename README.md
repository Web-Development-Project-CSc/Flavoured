# Flavoured

***Flavoured*** is an E-commerce web application created as the SWE23004 Web Development course project to showcase the ability of 5 students in full stack developing. The front-end of the application showcases the use of HTML and CSS and EC6 "*JavaScript*", while the back-end utilizes the MERN stack in its development.  

*Flavoured* is an online store that specializes in selling custom and specific food **flavourings** in various **shades**. The idea is to bring all customers the delight of enjoying their favourite snacks ; through emulating their taste and color, in two easy to use products *(powder - liquid)*. Many estimated flavours are available on the store from the get-go contrived of a collection of our team's favourite snacks and multiple surveys that were ran through our university, *MIU,* mates. Our slogan "***Taste the Shades***" was designed to imply that both the visuals and taste of our products mean a lot to us.
